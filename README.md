# My-Favorite-Movies
A list of my favorite movies organized using cards and modals to display movie information. 
This application uses bootstrap to stlyize and display the movies and thier information. Each movie is in a card grid. 
When the size of the viewing screen is at its max, 4 movies will be displayed in a row. When the screen gets smaller, 3 movies will be shown in a row and when the screen is at its smallest, each movie will have its own row and the display will be vertical. More movie information can be accessed by clicking "Learn More" and modal will popup with more indepth movie plot.
